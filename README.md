## Dependencies

Ensure that these dependencies are installed:

- git
- stow
- hyprpaper
- hypridle
- hyprlock
- wofi
- firefox
- waybar
- kitty
- swaync
- nemo

**Obs.:** Some errors can happen because some file links might be different on your system.
I don't recommend installing it using `stow` directly if you don't know what you're doing.
Maybe copying the files manually and fixing the errors is better for first-time travelers or just search more about stow :)

### Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/zekekk/dotfiles.git
$ cd dotfiles
```

use GNU stow to create symlinks

```bash
$ stow .
```
